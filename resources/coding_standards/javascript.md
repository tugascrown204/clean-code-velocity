# JavaScript Coding Standards

## Variables
- Use `const` for constants and `let` for mutable variables.
- Prefer descriptive names for variables.

## Functions
- Use camelCase for function names.
- Keep functions small and focused.

## General Practices
- Use strict equality (`===`, `!==`) for comparisons.
- Use arrow functions for anonymous functions where appropriate.
