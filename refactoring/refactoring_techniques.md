# Refactoring Techniques

## 1. Extract Method
- Turn a large method into smaller, reusable methods.

## 2. Inline Method
- If a method’s body is just as clear as its name, replace calls to it with the method’s content.

## 3. Rename Method
- Rename methods to be more descriptive regarding their action.

## 4. Move Method
- Move methods to a more appropriate class or module based on functionality.
